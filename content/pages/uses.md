## ⚙️ What I use

I almost never get asked about what's my setup is or what I use. Nonetheless, here is what I use on daily basis.

### Coding Software

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)- My friend [Scott Spences](https://twitter.com/spences10) introduced me to VS Code. At that time, we were both using Atom. I have never looked back.

[Jetbrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) - I like this font.

[Brave](https://brave.com/) - as my personal browser. I also use Chrome and sometimes Safari and Firefox.

[fairlyFloss](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nopjmp.fairyfloss) - As much as I love to try new themes in VSCode, I always come back to fairyFloss.

[iterm2](https://iterm2.com/) - My terminal of choice.

[Homebrew](https://cheatsheets.xyz/homebrew/) - For installing other libs and softwares.

[LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) - For gif capture.

### Gear

[Desk & Chair]() - Pretty much, any flat surface.
