The power of React Native as a framework continues to increase over time. For those who are unfamiliar, [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) is a cross-platform framework developed by Facebook. Itâ€™s open source and lets you build mobile applications using JavaScript as its core.

Thanks to Nicolas Gallagherâ€™s open source project [**React Native for Web**](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web)**,** now you can use React Native API components to build a web application that uses React DOM as its core. React Native already makes it convenient to write mobile apps for two platforms: iOS and Android. And now the web is slowly entering the picture. ðŸ¤©

_Sounds interesting, right?_ In this tutorial, thatâ€™s what weâ€™re going to do. Weâ€™re going to walk through, step-by-step, the process of integrating a Web App that uses React Native.

### Requirements

- NodeJS version `>= 8.x.x` and npm/yarn
- Basic understanding of ES6 JavaScript features, ReactJS, and React Native will be helpful.

### Getting Started: Create a ReactÂ App

To start, go to your terminal and install the following command line tools. The first one will help you scaffold a React app, and the other one will run a React Native app:

```shell
npm install -g create-react-app expo
```

> Note: You might have to use `sudo` in front of the above command if `npm` permissions are not set and everything is the default.

After the installation, run the following command from a terminal window in order to generate a new React project:

```shell
create-react-app reactnativeweb-demo
```

This will generate a new directory. A good thing about this project generating ( _official_) tool is that it already includes built-in support for aliasing `react-native-web` to `react-native`.

The next step is to install a couple more dependencies to make this project work like we want it to. Make sure you traverse inside the newly created project directory and then run the below command:

```shell
yarn add --dev babel-plugin-module-resolver
```

The babel plugin `babel-plugin-module-resolver` will help you resolve your project modules when compiling with Babel. React Native uses the Babel compiler internally. Now install the most essential dependencies, without which this project would not run.

```shell
yarn add react-native expo react-native-web
```

The last step, for now, is to create a file calledÂ `.babelrc` at the root of the project with the following snippet:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "module-resolver",
      {
        "alias": {
          "^react-native$": "react-native-web"
        }
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

> Note: If you want to configure a `react-native-web` app project where you use your own `webpack` configuration, or need to write modules with `jest`, or if youâ€™re a fan of `flow`, you should take a look [**at this link**](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web/blob/master/docs/guides/getting-started.md) in order to make things work properly.

### Running on theÂ Web

Before we proceed to build a demo application, letâ€™s see if the current configuration works or not. Open your `src/App.js` file and replace the content inside it with the following snippet of code:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text style={styles.text}>Hello, world!</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  text: {
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    fontSize: 30
  }
});

export default App;
```

Here, weâ€™re basically using the `react-native` API build UI components for the web application. Do note that, in React Native terms, `View` is the equivalent of a `div` in HTML and `text` is the equivalent of `p` or a `span`. There are a lot of similarities between the APIs of the mobile UI and the Web, but there are important differences to understand and keep in mind.

To run the application, go to a terminal window and write `npm start` and execute it. In a browser window, on visiting URL `http://localhost:3000` you will get the following result.

To verify that itâ€™s building a DOM tree to manage nodes, you can open up developer tools in your web browser and go to `inspect > Elements` to see the ids and classes with a random string created inside a typical React app.

Similar to a React app, the `App` component remains the entry point of our application. Also, the `index.js` file remains unchanged, so itâ€™s very important to note how easy it is to integrate a mobile framework and a web library.

### About Styling

React Native relies on JavaScript when it comes to styling component or UI elements. React Native for Web implements the React Native style API. To define a style, itâ€™s the same in a React Native app. All you have to do is declare a `StyleSheet` object, inside of which each styled property needs to be defined.

In our `App.js` file, weâ€™re implementing this. Take a look:

```js
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  text: {
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    fontSize: 30
  }
});
```

Some of the web units like `rem` and `em` are not supported by React Native, so the suggestion here is to avoid using them.

### Listing Elements

Rendering a list in React Native Web is similar to React Native for mobile. Letâ€™s add some mockup data and use `FlatList` container to display the content. Modify `App.js` as shown below:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, FlatList } from 'react-native';

class App extends React.Component {
  state = {
    StarWarsAPI: [
      {
        id: 1,
        name: 'Luke Skywalker'
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        name: 'C-3PO'
      },
      {
        id: 3,
        name: 'R2-D2'
      }
    ]
  };

  _keyExtractor = (item, index) => item.id;

  _renderItem = ({ item }) => (
    <View style={styles.listContainer}>
      <Text style={styles.listItem}>{item.name}</Text>
    </View>
  );

  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>Hello, world!</Text>
        <FlatList
          data={this.state.StarWarsAPI}
          keyExtractor={this._keyExtractor}
          renderItem={this._renderItem}
        />
      </View>
    );
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 10,
    flex: 1
  },
  text: {
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    fontSize: 30
  },
  listContainer: {
    paddingTop: 20
  },
  listItem: {
    fontSize: 20
  }
});

export default App;
```

If you run it in the browser, youâ€™ll get the following result.

### Conclusion

So far, youâ€™ve got the hang of the React Native for Web module. You learned how to integrate React Native as a component API and make it run in a web browser. React Native for Web does not support every React Native component API. It lacks support for `Modal`, `WebView`, `Slider`. Also some modules like `CameraRoll` and `ImageStore` are not completely supported, which is understandable but might be helpful if available in some use cases.

Individuals and companies who love to work with React Native are working to close the gap between the web and the framework itself. This will allow building multi-platform applications. Organizations like Expo are currently working on their own fork of React Native Web that might support many more APIs and components than React Native for Web, so the future seems bright in that sense. They will be releasing Expo web with Expo SDK `33.x.x`, so look out for that.

#### Some other resources worth lookingÂ at:

- [Create React Native Web App](https://github.com/orYoffe/create-react-native-web-app) is a CLI tool that manages your app better than the manual integration we did in this tutorial.
- [React Native for Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) is the module we used in this post.
