Hi, I'm Aman, currently working as a **Developer Advocate at [Draftbit](https://draftbit.com/)**. I've a background in Computer Science and since 2017 I've been working as a professional.

Currently I am enthusiastic about:

- Node.js
- React
- React Native & Expo
- DevRel

I love contributing in open-source as much as my knowledge allows me to. Back in 2018 I made my first open-source contribution by writing a Twitter Bot (the original one) in Node.js for [**freeCodeCamp**](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/100DaysOfCode-twitter-bot) and [**#100DaysOfCode**](https://twitter.com/_100Daysofcode) campaign which in recent years has gained a lot of attention (100k+ followers) among people who are getting into web development.

Over the years I've made some contributions to some projects and organizations such as Node.js, Gatsbyjs and freeCodeCamp both as a contributor and maintainer. In past, I've been awarded among [Top 200 Open Source Contributors by freeCodeCamp.org in 2018](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/announcing-our-freecodecamp-2018-top-contributor-award-winners-861da08a77e1/).

When I am not writing code or working on a blog post, I'm probably spending my time either [reading a book](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17657541.Aman_Mittal) or [traveling](https://www.instagram.com/amanhimselfcodes/).

I specifically write on JavaScript frameworks such as Node.js, React, and React Native.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What I use

I almost never get asked about what's my setup is or what I use. Nonetheless, here is what I use on daily basis.

### Coding Software

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)- My friend [Scott Spences](https://twitter.com/spences10) introduced me to VS Code. At that time, we were both using Atom. I have never looked back.

[Jetbrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) - I like this font.

[Brave](https://brave.com/) - as my personal browser. I also use Chrome and sometimes Safari and Firefox.

[fairlyFloss](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nopjmp.fairyfloss) - As much as I love to try new themes in VSCode, I always come back to fairyFloss.

[iterm2](https://iterm2.com/) - My terminal of choice, with ZSH shell.

[Homebrew](https://cheatsheets.xyz/homebrew/) - For installing other libs and softwares.

[LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) - For creating GIFs.
