Hi, I'm Aman. I currently live in New Delhi, India and I'm currently working as an contract fullstack developer, and at [Draftbit](http://draftbit.com/) as a technical writer . I've a background in Computer Science and since 2017 I've been working as a professional

Currently I am enthusiastic about:

- Node.js,
- React
- React Native & Expo

I love contributing in open-source as much as my knowledge allows me to. Back in 2018 I made my first open-source contribution by writing a Twitter Bot (the original one) in Node.js for [freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/100DaysOfCode-twitter-bot) and [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/_100Daysofcode) campaign which in recent years has gained a lot of attention (100k+ followers) among people who are getting into web development.

Over the years I've made some contributions to some projects and organizations such as Node.js, Gatsbyjs and freeCodeCamp both as a contributor and maintainer. In past, I've been awarded among [Top 200 Open Source Contributors by freeCodeCamp.org in 2018](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/announcing-our-freecodecamp-2018-top-contributor-award-winners-861da08a77e1/).

When I am not writing code or working on a blog post, I'm probably spending my time either [reading a book](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17657541.Aman_Mittal) or [traveling](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17657541.Aman_Mittal).

I specifically write on JavaScript frameworks such as Node.js, React, and React Native.
