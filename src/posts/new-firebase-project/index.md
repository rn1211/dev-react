Applications are often complex in terms of architecture. Usually, when they are implemented as full-stack or conjunction of a frontend and a backend application with a database.

If you are a solo developer trying to build out an MVP (minimum viable product) or a side project or a product app, handling the scalability of both frontend parts and the backend part of the application can take a considerable amount of time and effort.

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is one of the solutions for web or mobile applications to start that side project. It offers a complete backend solution in terms of:

- authorization
- authentication (with common social method providers such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple Sign-in)
- database
- hosting

There are other specific services provided by Firebase ML Kit and Cloud functions. That said, Firebase is a Backend as a Service (_BaaS_). It helps to write well-designed APIs in an opinionated way and by keeping the tech stack minimal.

## Create a new Firebase project from the console

To start a new Firebase app with a frontend framework or a library, the API keys are required. To obtain these API keys, you need access to a Firebase project. A new Firebase project is created from the Firebase console here [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

Now, click on the button `Add project` and then enter the name of the Firebase project.

You might see a loading screen like below when the project is being created.
