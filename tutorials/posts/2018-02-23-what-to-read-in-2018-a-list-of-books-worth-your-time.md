In 2017, I started my voracious reading journey with the word ‚Äúproductivity‚Äù in mind. In my workflow, I wanted to be as productive as I could but later realise that it has its limitations. First limitation that I come across as I continued on my path as I found that there is a vast field and there are sub-niches that fall under that word. I had to make a decision on how will I benefit more in terms of productivity itself but more importantly having/developing that mindset? I came across 28 books throughout the year. Few were recommendations from people who share similar goals as mine and few were picks of my own.

So let me ask. _Are you a creator/maker/shipper/builder/hustler/digital nomad/solopreneur/remote-worker/freelancer/bibliophile? üöÄüöÄüöÄ_

Any of these aforementioned fall in your goals/working routine, the list of books below will definitely help you out to achieve them or continue to work on them. After all, we are all work in progress.

Here is the list, in a tweet (handwriting is not so awesome, it indeed is cold here ‚ò∫Ô∏èüôÉ):

Here are the ones I manage to read this year:

On some of the books, I did even manage to write about them in detail. These are mostly my honest opinion about them and what tools they offer.
